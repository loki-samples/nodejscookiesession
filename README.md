# Node js cookies and seession without express
Majority of search result for cookie and seesion in node js uses express framework. For basic understanding it is better to implemnet session and cookies with
raw request and response objects. 
latest code shows session but look through the commit history to get cookie implementation also.
create self signed certificate using openssl and update the paths to work with https.
